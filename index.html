          <p>The 17 second snippet was uploaded in 2021 to the site WatZatSong.com. Since then, an online community has been eagerly searching for it. The original recording was said to have been made in 1999 in Spain, though these are only claims of the uploader and the supposed metadata of the recording. It is understood to have likely been recorded from a television, due to the precense of a signal emitted from NTSC TVs of the era. Due to the precense of certain instruments (notably the drum sampler), the original song could not have been created before 1983.</p>

          <h3 class="font-bold text-xl"><i>Title</i></h3>
          <p>While 'Everyone Knows That', 'Ulterior Motives' and 'World of Lies' are titles dubbed by the community searching for the song, there is of course the possibility that the song is actually named something different. In fact, it is very common for the original releases of 'lostwave' songs to be found to have completely different titles, so please take these titles as a grain of salt.</p>

          <p>The correct song <b>cannot be detected by Shazam, AHA Music, etc.</b> Any detections are false positives caused by the digital distribution of cover versions originating from after the search began.</p>
